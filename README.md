# CraftGame
## Tasks
### Finished
- Network(craftgame-tcp library on io.github.javaherobrine.net and child packages)
- JSON Engine(a simple json engine based on Nashorn JavaScript api,it provides JSON to Map and Object to JSON for many apis)
- Mods loader(you can't mix mc mods and craftgame mods)

### Doing
- Chemistry Engine(chemicals and reactions,I think it's hardly to finish because I never learn chemistry and I'm only a chemistry lover now,however,I will try my best to do it.If you don't like it,you can close it,but if you play as a client,you can't open or close it)
- Physics Engine(it's easier to finish physics engine than finish the chemistry engine because I start studying physics when I was in Grade 8) 

### Plan to do
- Program libraries for awa's project and help awa to change jawascript(one of awa's projects) into Java
